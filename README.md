This repository holds two presentations (in pdf and powerpoint formats) providing a very basic introduction to working with git.
These presentations were prepared for the "Introduction to Computational Research" seminar series at Syracuse.

# Part 1

Part 1, held in the "part1/" folder of this repository, is a guide to working with git locally.

# Part 2

Part 2, (shockingly) held in the "part2/" folder of this repository, sets up working with GitLab remotes, pushing, pulling, cloning, and managing conflicts
